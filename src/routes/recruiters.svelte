<Title title="Recruiters: Working with me" />

<p>
	If you are on this page then it's probably because you are either a recruiter or someone that has
	requested to interview or hire me. The current technology job climate has forced me to put up
	something on my site to answer questions in a more productive way.
</p>
<p>This page should clear up some things to make it an easier process for us.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-looking-for-a-job">Are you looking for a job?</h2>

<p>Yes, I am currently open to working on new projects.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-you-doing">What are you currently doing?</h2>

<p>
	I am currently doing contract development with a select few long-term clients. One of which has
	been a client for almost a decade now.
</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="will-you-relocate">Will you relocate?</h2>

<p>Sorry, currently not entertaining positions that require relocating.</p>
<p>
	Looking for fully or mostly remote positions. Mixed positions must be within a reasonable drive
	from Atlanta or Greensboro, Georgia.
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-position-are-you-looking-for">What position are you looking for?</h2>

<p>I am willing to do the following positions:</p>

<p><strong>Senior Application Developer</strong></p>
<p>I am a leader at heart, however, I do love to program just as much as leading.</p>
<p>
	My development career spans across more than a decade with several different technology stacks,
	industries and tools. I worked with PHP, Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, Elixir and others over the
	years. My current focus is on Svelte / React but open to anything fun or new. Learning and
	experimenting is the biggest benefit of being a developer.
</p>

<p><strong>Team Lead / Fractional CTO</strong></p>
<p>
	Sometimes startups can't afford to have a CTO on the payroll. I completely understand this fact of
	life. In those times, a good Team Lead or Fractional CTO works best. I have experience in both
	working with the technology and building teams. This combination allows for a flexible role
	description.
</p>

<p><strong>Chief Technology Officer / Director of Development</strong></p>
<p>
	I have over a decade of experience in leading teams and having oversight of the development
	process for several projects. Working with budgets, development efficiency, and hiring has been my
	a love of mine and will continue to be.
</p>

<h2 id="contract-or-salary-">Contract or Salary?</h2>
<p>
	I am open to both. As a longtime experienced freelancer, I don&#39;t fear contract positions. I do
	set my rates based on this factor though. Contract positions pay a slight premium to cover
	expenditures that would normally be covered by a salary job (healthcare, vacation, etc).
</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="salary-req">What are your salary requirements?</h2>

<p>
	That's a loaded question! My contract and salary rates change based on a few variables. This is
	highly dependent on factors like flexibility of work hours, benefits package, in-office vs remote,
	how much I like you, etc. There is a lot of wiggle room. If you have a number in mind then fire it
	off but I won't give you a specific number until I have learned enough about your business to give
	one.

<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>I have contributed to several open source projects over the years. Here are a few of them:</p>

</p>

<p>Not contributing to any projects at the moment but open to look at any if you have one.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="why-do-you-not-take-tests-">Why do you not take tests?</h2>
<p>
	I believe that technical tests are good for school and engagement with junior level developers to
	qualify that they have enough knowledge to be productive at work. However, I welcome and enjoy technical discussions.
</p>
<p>
	For me personally, I have spent a decade now proving that I have the technical aptitude to get the
	job done. If that is in question then you can always look at my prior work, talk to a long list of
	references that I have and also look at open source work. In the last 10 years, I have done well
	over 10,000 hours<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> of development. No, I am not the best at knowledge
	retention but I have learned to teach or re-teach myself things at an extraordinary pace.
</p>
<p>
	If testing applicants is a <em>must</em> for your position then please pass me up. You will waste both
	of our time. Feel free to ask questions about my skills but I will by no means take a timed test to
	prove anything.
