## Welcome

Oh, hey there. Didn't see you come in.

Welcome to my little space on the internet. This is were I'll be blogging about productivity, startups, and technology. This blog will be an intersection of everything that I learn and experiences that I have. If you are looking for topics within a specific category then I would suggest taking a look at the tags to further drill down.

## Who am I?

My name is Randi Miller and I have been working in the tech industry for about a decade now. I have worked roles as a developer, manager and consultant for startups and large organizations. I currently provide CTO-level services for clients thru [Modern Geek](https://moderngeek.io) to help them get their products built. I do development work still but only for a small circle of clients.

## Current Projects

[Podlio](https://podl.io) - A podcasting suite.
