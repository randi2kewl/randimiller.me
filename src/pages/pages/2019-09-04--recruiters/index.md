If you are on this page then it's probably because you are a recruiter or someone that has requested to interview or hire me. The current technology job climate has forced me to put up something on my site to answer questions on a mass basis.

This is not meant to be a jerk thing but I really do hate wasting my time and yours. This should clear up some things to make it an easier process for us.

## Are you looking for a job?

Yes, I am actively looking for positions that fit my future goals.

---

## Will you relocate?

I currently live in Atlanta, GA.

I am willing to relocate to very specific cities. If you feel that the position is worth moving to another city then ask. I swear that I don't bite.

Here is my current "willing to live in cities" list:

- Los Angeles, CA (preferred)
- Miami, FL
- New York City, NY
- San Francisco, CA

## What position are you looking for?

I am willing to do the following positions:

**Chief Technology Officer / Director of Development**

I have over 3 years of experience in leading teams and having oversight of the development process for several projects. Working with budgets, development efficiency, and hiring has been my a love of mine and will continue to be.

**Senior Application Developer**

I am a leader at heart, however, I do love to program just as much as leading.

My development career spans across almost a decade with several different technology stacks, industries and tools. My current goal is to focus on one specific stack over the next few years. Fullstack JavaScript using NodeJs and ReactJs (or the Gatsby framework) is currently what I prefer.

If it's not Javascript then I probably won't want the position so you are welcome to pass me up.

## Contract or Salary?

I am open to both. As a longtime experienced freelancer, I don't fear contract positions. I do set my rates based on this factor though. Contract positions pay a slight premium to cover expenditures that would normally be covered by a salary job (healthcare, vacation, etc).

## Why do you not take tests?

I believe that technical tests are good for school and engagement with junior level developers to qualify that they have enough knowledge to be productive at work.

For me personally, I have spent a decade now proving that I have the technical aptitude to get the job done. If that is in question then you can always look at my prior work, talk to a long list of references that I have and also look at open source work. In the last 10 years, I have done well over 10,000 hours<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> of development. No, I am not the best at knowledge retention but I have learned to teach or re-teach myself things at an extraordinary pace.

If testing applicants is a _must_ for your position then please pass me up. You will waste both of our time. Feel free to ask questions about my skills but I will by no means take a timed test to prove anything to your or the employer.

## What are your hobbies?

When I am not programming, I am playing video games (MMOs) or spending time with my spouse and dog. I do enjoy hiking and doing "city walks" on nice breezy days.

### Footnotes

<sup id="footnote-1">1</sup> The 10,000 hours is in reference to the book [_Outliers: The Story of Success_ by Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=outliers&qid=1570322898&sr=8-1) where he presents the theory that a person becomes an expert in an area after 10,000 hours of practicing the subject matter.
