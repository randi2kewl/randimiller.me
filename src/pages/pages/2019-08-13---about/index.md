## Welcome

Oh, hey there. Didn't see you come in.

## Who am I?

My name is Randi Miller and I have been working in the tech industry for about a decade now. I have worked roles as a developer, manager and consultant for startups and large organizations. I currently provide CTO-level services for clients thru [Modern Geek](https://moderngeek.io) to help them get their products built. I do development work still but only for a small circle of clients.

## Current Projects

[Podlio](https://podl.io) - A podcasting suite.
